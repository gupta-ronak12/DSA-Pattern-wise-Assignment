# DSA-Pattern-wise-Assignment
This repository is my personal Data Structures and Algorithms practice space, organized pattern wise. Right now, the Array folder contains 33 important array problems solved in Python.While solving these, I’ve worked with techniques like two pointers, sliding window, hashing using dictionaries and sets, prefix and suffix arrays, Kadane’s Algorithm, Dutch National Flag algorithm, binary search, heap based logic, and in place array manipulation.

Why this repo?
To focus on writing clean and optimized solutions while building strong fundamentals in problem solving.
